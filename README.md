Wilma
===========
Wilma is a Java based proxy and stub application, or in other words, a Service Virtualization solution. It consists of two applications:

* Wilma application
* Wilma Message Search application

**Wilma application** acts as a proxy between two components those are communicating over HTTP/HTTPS. It logs the messages, and makes it possible to stub/mock requests based on the configuration defined in an XML file(s). Also configurable via plugins.
**Wilma Message Search application** provides high performance searching of the request-response pairs that were logged by Wilma application.
